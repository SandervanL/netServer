# netServer
This is the server I wrote with NodeJS Javascript, which I use on my website.

The main file is netServer.js, which doesn't work without the netFunctions.js.
The name netServer.js derives from the NodeJS library 'net', it uses, the code is not very well commented, because I wrote it mainly for myself.
